This repository contains a MATLAB function that demonstrates an uncommon error. The function `myFunction` has an explicit error check for negative input, but other issues might arise in unexpected situations. The bugSolution.m file provides a solution to address this issue and improve the overall robustness of the code.  Feel free to explore the code and contribute to identifying other potential issues.
